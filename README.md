This is a project to build a multi-page responsive website.

19-Nov-2020 Update
So far I have built the landing/main page of the website. I have spent a lot of time experimenting with and developing the javascript for the 'my setup' sections. I am pretty happy with it for now and have merged the branch, called "feature-expandable-setup-items", into the main. 

Further development to be explored down the line:
- Animate the 'opening' and 'closing' of the 'more-info' portions of each item. 

There are currently two active branches:
1. Main
2. Feature-polaroid-gallery

In the main branch, the gallery images appear as circles. In the polaroid gallery, I have played around with making the photos look like they are polaroid images. This is still under development. 
- The 'polaroids' do not hold their aspect as the browser is resized. That needs to be addressed and is probably a matter to be given some priority.

A lot of work still to do in general, including:
- Implementing call-to-action buttons. I am thinking I could have a button in each of the intro sections, under the tagline, and another button in each of the 'my adventures' sections, under the gallery photos. Styling-wise, I prefer rectangular buttons with slightly rounded corners, clear buttons with black or dark grey border, and black or dark grey writing. Of course, we will need to work out where we want those buttons to take us.
- Navigation bar - need to work out where I want those to go. I think I would like a zoom on :hover - do we do this using CSS selectors or javascript? TBD.
- Footer with relevant attributions.
- Logo?
- Media queries and styling for tablet and mobile viewport-sizes.

Second page to website:
- List-making webpage.
