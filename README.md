This is a project to build a multi-page responsive website. This is the first project I have done of this scale.

Update 23 November 2020

I have spent the majority of the recent days working on the 'plan your adventure' / list-maker page of the website. I am pretty happy with its functionality now. I feel that the design could be finessed somehow, but I am not sure in what way. At present I have gone for a simple look, styled consistently with the main page.

Previously I had my 'to-do list' laid out in this file, but I have since converted them to 'issues', and organised them on a project board. Feel free to have a squiz to see what I am working on.
